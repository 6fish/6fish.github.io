title: Chinese Beef Pie and Jiu Cai He Zi (Chive Boxes)
date: 2018-06-30
---

Following the Asian theme from last week, we made something with our own dough: Chinese beef pies and chive boxes. Fish's mom recently started making her own beef pies, which was the inspiration for that part, and Six's family makes their own chive boxes, so we both knew what the end product should be...except neither of us had actually made them alone from scratch.

Part one was figuring out exactly what to put. Six insisted on shrimp for the chive boxes; in fact, he insisted on both dried and fresh shrimp, which he blended together in our handy food processor. The other ingredients are pretty standard: egg, chives, and vermicelli.

The ingredients for the beef pie were a little more elusive. Fish wasn't certain what her mom uses, but we sort of hand-waved it with some minced beef, scallions, ginger, garlic, white pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Six suggested (credit to his dad) putting in an egg to help the filling stay together better, which actually worked really well.
